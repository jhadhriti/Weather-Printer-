# Weather-Printer-
This is a python powered tool which helps in fetching weather data from two reliable sources. I have tried to incorporate all the functions based on the instructions and make the interface user-friendly. Any helpful suggestion/edits is welcome.

## Getting started/Installation
Installation is as easy as cloning the repository and (if you want the tool to work in any directory) adding the same to PATH environment variables

### Cloning
1. To clone we use CLI
```
git clone https://github.com/jhadhriti/Weather-Printer-
```

2. Next, we run the program. All we have to do is run the program. If we want to fetch the verbose data we can type:
```
python3 test.py --verbose
```
   
3. Now you have the weather data at your fingertips.

## Demonstration
1. To obtain only-temperature based data, we simply run the program. The output will be shown as:

2. For weather data we follow the above instructions and get the output as:
